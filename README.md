# Robotic-Arm 

## Design of Robotic arm 
   This Project is aimed to design a basic pick and place Robot.It has 3 Degrees of Freedom
  
   ### Degrees of freedom :
   The number of independent motions a device can make in 3 Dimensional space.
   
   ### Sensor used: Accelerometer 
   Accelerometer is a device that measures proper acceleration of a device.It is used to find the variation in the acceleration and convert into voltage values.
   It is used to detect the variation in static and dynamic acceleration.
   
   ### Components:
   
   1- Arduino uno board
   
   2- Servo Motors - 4
   
   3- Accelerometer (ADXL - 335)
   
   4- Jumper wires
   
   5- Battery
   
   6- Robotic Arm Kit
